    "# Anova Feature Selection Method by `Mr. Harshit Dawar!`\n",
    "* It is used to Test the Hypothesis that 2 or more features are having the same mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It is also a Univariate Feature Selection Method.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It stands for Analysis of Variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It can be used for Categorical as well as Numerical Features.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* It also calculates the p-value of the Features. The less the p - value is for a particular feature, the more the significance of that particular feature. But be cautiaus with this fact in very large dataset, because there the sample size may make the p-value of some feature to be very small, but in that case there might be a possibility that the feature is not that much strong to predict the Target."
