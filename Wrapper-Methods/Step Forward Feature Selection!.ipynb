    "* This algorithm falls under the category of Wrapper Methods, that guarantees to select the best subset of features for a particular Machine Learning algorithm!\n",
    "\n",
    "* This algorithm starts by training the model using one feature from all the features that are present in the dataset, then selects the one that is performing best, then it again runs with the best feature selected in the previous round, & selects the best 2 features in a group that provides the best performance. Likewise, this algorithm keeps on increasing the features, unless & until a stopping condition is met.\n",
