    "# Exhaustive Feature Selection by `Mr. Harshit Dawar!`\n",

    "* This algorithm falls under the category of Wrapper Methods, that guarantees to select the best subset of features for a particular Machine Learning algorithm!\n",
    "\n",
    "* This algorithm starts by training the model using all the possible subsets of the Features. This is the most computationally expensive way to select the Features, but on the other hand, it provides the best feature subset for a particular alogrithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "* To make it practically possible, a custom range can be given for the featues, like (1 - 5), this means that the algorithm will make all the possible combinations by taking 1 to 5 features, & then returning the best subset of the features.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Now, that being said, let's proceed towards the practical."
